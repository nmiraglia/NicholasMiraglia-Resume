        My name is Nicholas Miraglia. I am currently an Undergraduate History Major at University of California, Riverside. My goal is to attend law school.<br><br>

	My research interests in History focus on United States social movements of the 20th century. Of particular emphasis is the comparison between the Civil Rights Movement and the LGBT rights movement. This comparative approach extends to other movement
s, including studying the parallels and differences in how particular members of races approached adovcacy for Civil Rights, and how individual activists approached the Civil Right’s Movement.<br><br>

	Currently, I am serving as the Aberdeen-Inverness Residence Hall Association Building President. In this role, I am responsible for planning, budgeting, and executing programs in the residence hall. This requires budgeting skills, and keeping track of money spent in order to prepare budget reports as well as ensure money is left for future programs. A separate function of the role is to reach out to residents to receive feedback for improving the building, and submitting proposals based on these recommendations to the housing department. This role requires planning, organization, communication, budgeting, and writing skills. I consider this an important job because it is the first time I have had a position that involves frequent communication with professionals.<br><br> 
	
	I am an Eagle Scout, have served as Senior Patrol Leader, and am currently an Assistant Scoutmaster. In these roles I have learned leadership skills, including communication, effective supervision, conflict resolution, and public speaking. Working in these roles has taught me the values of Servant Leadership, which is working alongside those that you are supervising rather than working above them. I consider becoming an Eagle Scout my single greatest accomplishment due to everything that was done in order to get to that point.<br><br>

	My current job is as a Crew Member at McDonald’s. In this role I have learned to effectively work in a high stress, fast paced environment in which teamwork and fast decision making is a necessity. Additionaly, I have gained experience interacting with customers in a cordial manner, oftentimes helping to resolve conflicts due to errors. I am experienced enough in the role that I am often relied upon to train new employees.<br><br> 

	One of my main areas of focus in the past has been childcare. I’ve worked for 4 years for a day camp in Newport Beach. I also volunteered for Cubscout Day Camp for 5 years. In these roles I’ve further developed leadership skills, incuding responsibility, conflict resolution within the group, and tailoring behavior based on the group being interacted with.<br><br>
